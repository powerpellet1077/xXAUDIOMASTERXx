# xXAUDIOMASTERXx (xxamxx)
simple audio enshittifier. no further introduction needed

### usage
```
xxamxx input.mp3 output.mp3
```

takes an input audio file and decreases the quality to the best settings to make it sound like dogshit. this supports a wide range of audio types (please refer to pydub's documentation for format support).
if you feel like these settings aren't good, then you can use these flags.
```
xxamxx input.mp3 output.mp3 -f 0.8 -g 2
```
-f and -g (--fr and --grain) are multipliers of the default framerate and grain, using ``-g 2`` doubles the amount of grain and ``-f 0.5`` doubles the quality where ``-f 2`` halves the quality (I made it confusing). Just think that the higher the number, the worse the quality.


you can also remove the extra artifacts I put in there to make it sound worse if that helps.
